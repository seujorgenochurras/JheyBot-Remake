# Introduction
This is a remake of a bot that i has made with Javascript in _Discord_, The difference now
is that i made it using Java with the JDA API (which is good af btw). 
## Why?
If for some reason you do care about this, im doing the remake just because im liking Java 
and i want to learn more about OOP.

## How?
Im still learning about Maven, so idk how to build it. <br>
But the .env.example is where you probably want to go first. There, you will see the configuration
which right now is just the bot token.
