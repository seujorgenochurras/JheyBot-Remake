# Introduction
This is a remake of a bot that I have made with Javascript in _ Discord _, 
The difference is that i now made it using Java with the JDA API (which is good af btw).

## Why?
If for some reason you do care about this, I'm doing the remake just because im liking Java 
and I want to learn more stuff about OOP.

## How?
I'm still learning about Maven, so idk how to build it. <br>
But the .env.example is where you probably want to go first. There, you will see the configuration
which right now is just the bot token.
